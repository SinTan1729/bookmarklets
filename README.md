# scihub_bookmark
Javascript bookmarklet for Sci-Hub

The Javascript code will insert https://sci-hub.do in front of the URL of your current tab and reload the page (or open a new tab if you choose that script).

To use, create a new bookmark and paste the Javascript code into the address box. If you do not have access to a paper, clicking the bookmark will reload the page using Sci-Hub.
